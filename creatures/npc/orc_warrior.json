  "description": "Orcs are strong humanoids who live in well-organized clan societies. Some are settled, digging vast tunnel systems deep beneath the woods and mountains; others wander the vast steppes of the world as nomads. Orcs often have a formidable appearance: glowing black eyes, fangs the size of a wild beastâ€™s tusks, and hard, vaguely camouflage-patterned skin. They are fierce warriors, widely respected for their undeniable bravery and weapon proficiency both in melee and at range. But orcs are also extremely honor-oriented and have an unfortunate tendency to cause territorial disputes and never-ending blood feuds with dwarves, giants, and other kin.",
