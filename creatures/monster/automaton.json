These tireless guardians are often found patrolling ancient ruins, wizard towers, or treasure vaults. They obey their creatorâ€™s commands without hesitation, attacking intruders with mechanical precision. Unlike living creatures, automatons feel no pain or fear, and continue to function until completely destroyed.",
